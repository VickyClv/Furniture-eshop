                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <h5>VIOL was founded by Vicky and Olga in the town of Athens, Greece. Vicky and Olga are two college students of Athens 
                    University of Economics & Business who major in computer science. What brought them together
                    was their common interest in programming and home decor. That's why they decided to creat VIOL. However what 
                    makes VIOL different from other furniture companies? In VIOL our main focus is the quality of our products. We 
                    want our industry to become greener with more sustainable products, yet without sacrificing style over quality.
                    Our goal in the near future is to reclaim and upcycle furniture.

                    furniture and furniture packages are consisted of recycled products. In every product we have added a
                    section called 'environmental information' that empasizes on what makes each product eco-friendly. Furthermore
                    we have concluded many different style-groups with unique designs.

                <h4>Vasiliki Kolovou</h4>
                <h5>Programmer/Web developer</h5>
                <p>I was born in Athens, Greece. In 2007 I attended a private school in Venezuela which taught me how 
                    to adapt in a new environment. In 2013, I received a commendation on the 7th student competition 
                    "Game and Mathematics" by the Greek Mathematical Company. In 2019, I graduated high-school with 
                    honors and entered the department of Informatics of the school of Information Sciences and Technology 
                    in the Athens University of Economics and Business at the 32nd place. My avocations include 
                    programming, game and web developing, learning new languages such as Japanese, Korean, German, French 
                    and Spanish and expanding my knowledge on the ones I've already mastered such as English.</p>

                <p>Hey there! My full name is Olga-Maria Kavourinou and I am a programmer based in Athens, Greece.
                    I was born and raised in Greece and graduated from school in 2019. I am currently majoring in computer science
                    at the Athens University of Economics and Business and I have 1 year left to finish my studies
                    .My passions include coding, most of the times next to my dog, interior design and
                    playing piano. Once I finish college I am looking forward to start my career as a web developer.</p>
